# Manual: Princeton Oar

## Packages and Contents
1. Two cans of paint in Princeton Orange (Pantone, yes) and pure black.
2. A wooden oar/paddle.
  * Apparently there aren't too many people making these around the world, so I was forced to sketch it myself and cut it on a bandsaw/scrollsaw. I did my best.
  
## Guide
This should be all you need:

## Requirements
* Quality be **better** than **or equal to** the shield we made together.
* Stickers are allowed, but I didn't buy you paint for nothing.

## Restrictions
* You **MUST** use the original piece of wood. 
* You may however:
  * Sand it
  * Paint it
  * Smooth edges
* You may not:
  * Cut it
  * Use a router on it
  * Modify it in any way that makes it unrecognizable.
  
In short, if you ever get demented, I want the paddle to remind you of me.

## Due Date
Must be completed before the Thanksgiving Turkey goes in the brine.

## Closing
Happy Birthday, I hope this begins to repair the emotional damage wrought by losing the original. Enjoy!
